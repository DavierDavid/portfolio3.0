        <div id="edu-textbox" class="animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInLeft">In 2019, I got accepted into a course in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. It was Immersive Media and Game Design. Seeing that it was similar to what I did back in ITE, I accepted. But, it wasn't as simple as I thought. The work was a lot tougher and I had to work twice as hard as before. Along the way, I made everlasting friendships which helped me push through. I have also learnt new skills and software, like 3D modeling with Autodesk Maya, texturing with substance painter, video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro, and many more! As of 2021, I am in my third year, my final year. I hope to be able to deliver quality work and graduate in 2022.</div>

        <div id="edu-textbox" class="animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInRight animate__delay-1s">In 2017, I was enrolled into a course in ITE College Central, NITEC in Social media and Web development. 
            Throughout my course, I learnt the fundamentals of programming,
            I programmed with Adobe Dreamweaver and worked with other softwares like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Animate.
            For the final year, instead of internship, we were given a final year project! And finally with hardwork and determination, I graduated in 2018 with essential skills and knowledge which would carry me to my next point in life.</div>
